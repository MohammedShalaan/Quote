            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes">
                “I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things
                go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to
                trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.”
                ― Marilyn Monroe

                “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones
                you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your
                sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”
                ― H. Jackson Brown Jr., P.S. I Love You
